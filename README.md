# Chess Piece SDK

This repository contains a single file, index.html, which provides an interface to connect to a [Lumen](https://www.kiiroo.com/products/ohmibod-lumen-powered-by-kiiroo) (or any other Bluetooth-enabled butt plug) and control its vibration level and duration from a Chromium-based browser.

The interface is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Users can set the level and duration of the vibration, and control it directly from the browser.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a simple and accessible way for users to interact with their Bluetooth butt plug. By making this code open-source, we hope to encourage other developers to contribute and improve the code, and to provide a platform for users to share their experiences and feedback.
